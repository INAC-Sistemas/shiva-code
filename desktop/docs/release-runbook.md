# Desktop release runbook

## Release tags

A release is cut by pushing `shiva-desktop-v<semver>`, for example `shiva-desktop-v0.7.2`. This repository also releases the harness, under `dsh-v*`, so the prefix says which product a tag ships. The semver after the prefix becomes the published application version and keys the ModelScope rollback archive at `releases/archive/<semver>/`, so it must continue the sequence already published rather than restart from the version in `package.json`, which the workflow overwrites from the tag.

A production-parity pre-release skips tagging: dispatch the workflow with `prerelease_tag` set to a bare semver such as `2.1.0-rc.1`.

## Local Windows UKey signing runner

Windows packaging and signing run as separate jobs. The GitHub-hosted Windows runner builds an unsigned NSIS installer and uploads a short-lived workflow artifact. A local macOS ARM64 runner downloads it, signs the installer with Jsign and the SafeNet UKey, regenerates the blockmap and `latest.yml`, and uploads the signed release set. The GitHub Release job cannot start unless signing succeeds.

Prepare the local runner once:

1. Register it with the `self-hosted`, `macOS`, and `ARM64` labels.
2. Install SafeNet Authentication Client and confirm `/usr/local/lib/libeTPkcs11.dylib` is readable.
3. Connect the UKey before pushing a release tag.
4. In the GitHub repository, open **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and create a repository secret named `DESKTOP_WINDOWS_SIGNING_PIN` containing the UKey PIN. For stronger release controls, use an environment secret and add the matching `environment` to the `sign-windows` job.
5. Restrict release tag creation and workflow changes to trusted maintainers. A self-hosted runner can access any secret injected into its job.

The workflow pins Jsign 7.5 by SHA-256 and uses the SafeNet `ETOKEN` store, SHA-256 signing, and a DigiCert RFC 3161 timestamp. GitHub injects the PIN only into the signing step. The step copies it to a mode-`600` temporary file, removes it from the shell environment, and deletes the file when the step exits. The workflow never prints the PIN or passes it as a command-line argument.

After a tag release succeeds, verify that the Windows installer shows the expected publisher and a valid RFC 3161 timestamp in its Digital Signatures properties. Never reuse a published tag; fix the issue and release a new version.
